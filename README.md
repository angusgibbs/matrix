* Subtracting matrices
* Multiplying matrices
* Finding the determinant of a *n* by *n* matrix
* Creating a *n* by *n* identity matrix
* Raising a *n* by *n* matrix to the *x<sup>th</sup>* power
* Multiplying each element in the matrix by a scalar
* Checking two matrices for equivalence
* Inverting a matrix
